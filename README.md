### 👋 Hi there! I'm Gavin :blush:

I'm a third year student studying Software Engineering at 🎓 Singapore Institute of Technology. My specialties include being a quick learner (language agnostic), problem-solving, and writing clean code.  I love sharing my knowledge with others and making a positive impact - seeing others grow, learn, and succeed through the knowledge I share brings me great joy! 🌱

When not coding:
🎸 I'm into rock/metal music, following the local music scene
⚽ I support Leicester City Football Club
📱 On Reddit
🍣 Binge eating Japanese food
🎮 Playing games with friends
