### 👋 Hi there! I'm Gavin :blush:

I'm a third-year student studying Software Engineering at 🎓 Singapore Institute of Technology. My specialties include being a quick learner (language agnostic), problem-solving, and writing clean code, having experience across the web-stack (frontend, backend and devops). I love sharing my knowledge with others and making a positive impact - seeing others grow, learn, and succeed through the knowledge I share brings me great joy! 🌱

When not coding:
🎸 I'm into rock/metal music, following the local music scene <br/>
⚽ I support Leicester City Football Club <br/>
📱 On Reddit <br/>
🍣 Binge eating Japanese food <br/>
🎮 Playing games with friends <br/>

Sometimes, I write about tech stuff on my blog at gavinloo.com 😋
